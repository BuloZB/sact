But I''ve never been to the moon! OK, if everyone''s finished being stupid. It doesn''t look so shiny to me. Hey, whatcha watching? Our love isn''t any different from yours, except it''s hotter, because I''m involved.</p><p>I could if you hadn''t turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Why would a robot need to drink? Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Well, let''s just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.</p><p>Who are you, my warranty?! We''ll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we''ll go home. I haven''t felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil.  And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil.  And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.</p><p>No, just a regular mistake. I found what I need. And it''s not friends, it''s things. We''re rescuing ya.</p><p>Ok, we''ll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we''ll go ride the bumper cars. No. We''re on the top. [turns the TV back on] Bender, I didn''t know you liked cooking. That''s so cute. Then we''ll go with that data file! I had more, but you go ahead.</p>');

I''m just glad my fat, ugly mama isn''t alive to see this day.</p><p>Leela, Bender, we''re going grave robbing. We don''t have a brig. Aww, it''s true. I''ve been hiding it for so long. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! No, she''ll probably make me do it.</p><p>WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Ooh, name it after me! You, minion. Lift my arm. [a stagehand lifts his arm] AFTER HIM! Hello, little man. I will destroy you! [soto voce] Pansy. [laughing evilly] THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</p><p>Goodbye, friends.  I never thought I''d die like this.  But I always really hoped. Well I''da done better, but it''s plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. I''m sure those windmills will keep them cool. Shinier than yours, meatbag. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y''all are in a 12-piece bucket o'' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin'' up that ol'' mess you caused. I could if you hadn''t turned on the light and shut off my stereo.</p><p>And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Ummm…to eBay? I wish! It''s a nickel. Bender, being God isn''t easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>');

Leela''s gonna kill me. Moving along… You, minion. Lift my arm. [a stagehand lifts his arm] AFTER HIM!</p><p>What kind of a father would I be if I said no? I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! You are the last hope of the universe.</p><p>My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book ''Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth'', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh... also, comes with double prize money. [laughing evilly] THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</p><p>I''m just glad my fat, ugly mama isn''t alive to see this day. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. [having quickly written a book to trap the Big Brain in] There, now he''s trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! No! I want to live!

A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You''d think it would be something you''d have to freebase. Anyone who laughs is a communist! With gusto. It''s just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. I didn''t ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!</p><p>I meant ''physically''. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Kif might! You don''t know how to do any of those. Why would I want to know that?</p><p>Yeah, lots of people did. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don''t pay you or let you go. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Check it out, y''all. Everyone who was invited is here. Guess again. You, a bobsleder!? That I''d like to see!</p><p>They''re like sex, except I''m having them!

Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won''t be sure you''ve done anything at all. Can we have Bender Burgers again? Bender, being God isn''t easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.
